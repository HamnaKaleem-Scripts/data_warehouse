# Data Warehouse Project

## Overview
This project involves the design and implementation of a Data Warehouse to support analytical queries and business intelligence reporting. The Data Warehouse integrates data from multiple sources and organizes it in a structured format for efficient querying and analysis.

## Features
- Centralized data storage for historical and transactional data
- ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process to clean and integrate data
- Star and Snowflake schema implementation
- Optimized for OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)
- Support for BI tools like Power BI, Tableau, and SSRS

## Technologies Used
- **Database Management System**: Microsoft SQL Server / PostgreSQL / MySQL
- **ETL Tools**: SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services) / Talend / Informatica
- **Scripting**: Python / SQL Scripts
- **BI & Visualization**: Power BI / Tableau / Looker

## Data Sources
The Data Warehouse is built by integrating data from various sources, including:
- Relational Databases (e.g., ERP, CRM systems)
- Flat Files (CSV, Excel, JSON)
- API-based data sources

## Schema Design
- **Fact Tables**: Store transactional data (e.g., sales, orders, revenue)
- **Dimension Tables**: Store descriptive attributes (e.g., customer, product, time)
- **Surrogate Keys**: Used for better performance and data integrity

## ETL Process
1. **Extract**: Data is pulled from source systems
2. **Transform**: Cleaning, filtering, and aggregating data
3. **Load**: Storing processed data into the Data Warehouse

## How to Run the Project
1. Install the required database system (SQL Server, PostgreSQL, etc.).
2. Set up ETL tools and configure connections.
3. Load data from source systems.
4. Run SQL scripts to create schema and populate tables.
5. Connect BI tools for visualization and reporting.

## Future Improvements
- Implement real-time data processing
- Improve query performance using indexing and partitioning
- Automate ETL pipelines using cloud services
